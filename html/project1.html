   <h2>Early Internet Memory</h2>
   <p>
     I've always had a huge <span>passion</span> for dancing
     <br> and singing. Therefore, games like Just Dance caught my interests as well as choir. However, my family didn't have the resources to own gaming consoles. Then to my sister and I resorted to "pla 
     <br> ying" Just Dance by following YouTube videos. In addition to dancing, we also had so much fun singing along to Sing King karaoke videos which fulfilled what choir couldn't. YouTube was an easy and fast way to get <span>free access</span> to content in order to get rid of our boredom. Today, many parents try the same method of just handing their kids a tablet to entertain themselves. But the difference here being that I was active and practicing skills; While many kids just end up watching influencer content. YouTube is effective but I think there are different ways to use it, for example in a more educational aspect.
